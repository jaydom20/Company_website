              Maison Organisée 6 months ago<br />
              to overhaul our living space -<br />
              from the kitchen, to the living<br />
              room, to the kid's playroom. We<br />
              worked with Mindy who was<br />
              excellent from start to finish. She<br />
              brought tons of great experience<br />
              to the table and was such a<br />
              pleasure to work with along the<br />
              way. She not only replicated the<br />
              ideal set up we had in mind but<br />
              made it 10x better. Our home is<br />
              truly our happy place now and<br />
              my wife and the kids couldn't be<br />
              happier. Thank you, Maison<br />
